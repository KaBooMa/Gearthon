- Delete tweakables
- Swap x/z keys (maybe just do away with the keybinds and add better stepping?... Causes constant issues)
- Right click add attachment possibility, if better than ctrl
- Home page, hotkeys in editor
- Hide is_part_pairing_limited for now
- Description on the flags
- Fix lag caused over time w/ lua scripts

- version control mods. So if a mod was made with v1 GearThon, v0.9 isn't allowed
- Ability to create new of existing; For example, new wheel w/ WheelBehaviour
- attachment images to show what there is available? Might have to cycle every x seconds. Or just a simple list when hovering
