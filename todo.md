High Priority
- Move around the updating for BepInEx at least so it can pull the latest URL from the new release.
- Look into a way to handle multi-model objs. For like, painting individually, running Lua over them, etc. Think spinning blades inside a propeller

Normal Priority
- Some way to use gearblock materials on parts? Maybe a dropdown when making a part
- Add support for procedural parts
- Right click add attachment possibility, if better than ctrl
- Description on the flags
- joystick support
- Try to parse quad objs by making two triangles if possible
- Darkly (maybe others) cause the editor menu to be the same color text and bg
- Add option to recalculate the normal when loaded for part (RecalculateNormal() in OBJParser)

Low Priority
- demo parts/mods available for download to view how things work
- provide UX from toasts
- part friction sliders in editor
- enable/disable mods
- Implement is_part_pairing_limited
- Ability to create new of existing; For example, new wheel w/ WheelBehaviour
- attachment images to show what there is available? Might have to cycle every x seconds. Or just a simple list when hovering
- version control mods. So if a mod was made with v1 Gearthon, v0.9 isn't allowed
