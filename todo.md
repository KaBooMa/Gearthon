High Priority
- Add link types to parts

Normal Priority
- Guidance in editor, maybe youtube video? link in editor if so
- Right click add attachment possibility, if better than ctrl
- Description on the flags
- joystick support
- Home page, hotkeys in editor
- Try to parse quad objs by making two triangles if possible
- Figure out better way to track updates across GearLib, Gearthon and Editor
- Darkly (maybe others) cause the editor menu to be the same color text and bg

Low Priority
- demo parts/mods available for download to view how things work
- provide UX from toasts
- part friction sliders in editor
- enable/disable mods
- Implement is_part_pairing_limited
- Ability to create new of existing; For example, new wheel w/ WheelBehaviour
- attachment images to show what there is available? Might have to cycle every x seconds. Or just a simple list when hovering
- version control mods. So if a mod was made with v1 Gearthon, v0.9 isn't allowed
